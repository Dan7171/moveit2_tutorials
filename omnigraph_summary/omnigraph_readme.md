# Summary of omni graph nodes

## Type of input/outputs/nodes in graphs:

### Nodes:
- On Playback Tick 
node to execute other graph nodes every simulation frame.
This is a form of a family of nodes called  "event nodes" and its very common.

- Custom Python ROS 2 Node
custom node.

- To String 
node to convert the output of our custom node to a string.

- Print Text 
node to display the output of our custom node (as string) to the viewport or terminal. Edit this nodeâ€™s properties, in the Property panel, and check the To Screen attribute to display the text in the viewport.

# Examples: graphs explained:
## image1.png:
- Was taken from this video (good tutorial): https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_omnigraph.html

- What do we see in the image?
1. The action graph rotates a cube (which is a prim).
2. Nodes: 

- On tick: triggers the node its sending input to every simulation step. Triggered by the simulation step. 

- Read prim attributes: reads the attributes (states) of a specific prim (in this case, the cube).
In this example, it selected a specific attribute: the rotation euler xyz (in radians I guess).



- Costant float: outputs a constat (in this case, 1)


- Break 3 vector: splits a vector in R3 to x,y,z (so you can use a specific index of it). In the exampele, it takes input from the read prim node. We read the cube state.


- Add: just adding two numbers.

- Make 3 vector: used to recompose the old vector we "broke", + change in the y value (we added 1 using the add node with constant 1)



- Write prim attributes: writes the attributes (states) of a specific prim (in this case, the cube).
It's used here to re-write the pose of the cube.
It rotates the cube around the 1 axis by 1 unit of angle (I guess 1 radians) every time step (every simulation step).
